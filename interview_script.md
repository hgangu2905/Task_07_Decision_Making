# 🎙️ AI Street Interview — Claude.ai Explains the Student Performance Dataset

**Interviewer:** Hey Claude! I’ve got a dataset of student scores — mind helping us break it down?

---

### **Q1: How many students are there in the dataset?**

**Claude:**  
This dataset contains exactly 1,000 students — it’s a nice clean round number. So everything we analyze is based on those 1,000 observations.

---

### **Q2: What is the average math score?**

**Claude:**  
The average math score is 66.09. That gives us a pretty good benchmark for what a “typical” student scored in math. It also helps flag who’s falling behind or outperforming.

### **Q3: Which subject had the highest average score among students?**

**Claude:**  
Among math, reading, and writing — reading takes the top spot with an average score of about 69.2. That’s followed by writing at 68.05, then math at 66.09. So overall, students did best in reading.

### **Q4: How many students completed the test preparation course?**

**Claude:**  
A total of 358 students completed the test preparation course — that’s about 36% of all students. It’ll be interesting to see whether that made a difference in their performance.

### **Q5: What are the average total scores of male and female students?**

**Claude:**  
Female students had an average total score of 208.71, while male students averaged 197.51. So females outperformed males by about 11 points overall.

---

### **Q6: How many students scored a total below 150?**

**Claude:**  
103 students had a total score below 150 — that’s roughly 10% of the entire dataset. These students may need extra academic support.

---

### **Q7: Which parental education group has the highest average total score?**

**Claude:**  
Students whose parents have a master’s degree performed the best — they had the highest average total score among all education groups. This aligns with research showing a strong link between parental education and student performance.

---

### **Q8: Who benefits more from test preparation — males or females?**

**Claude:**  
Both genders show improvement, but females benefit slightly more. On average, female students improved by about 15.4 points after taking the prep course, while males improved by around 14.2 points.

---

### **Q9: Which subject shows the most variation in student performance?**

**Claude:**  
Writing actually shows the most variation — its standard deviation is slightly higher than that of math or reading. That means students are more spread out in writing scores, indicating a wider range of writing ability.

**Interviewer:** That was super helpful, Claude. Thanks for explaining it so clearly!

**Claude:** Anytime! I love breaking down numbers into plain language. Keep analyzing!
